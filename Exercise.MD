# Git Class Exercise Worksheet (Student Version)

This worksheet contains hands‑on Git exercises **without solutions**.  
Follow the instructions step by step, using your terminal and IDE.

---

## Block 0 – Setup & Ground Rules

1. Verify that Git is installed.
2. Create a new working directory for this class.
3. Navigate into your workspace.

Write down any issues you encounter.

---

## Block 1 – First Local Repository: Core Workflow

1. Create a new folder for a project.
2. Initialize it as a Git repository.
3. Create a new Python file inside it.
4. Check the repository status.
5. Stage the file.
6. Commit the change with a meaningful message.
7. View the commit history.

---

## Block 2 – Changing & Undoing Safely

1. Modify the file you created earlier.
2. Check the status and review the changes.
3. Stage and commit the updated file.
4. Introduce an intentional mistake into the file.
5. Explore how to compare this broken version with the committed version.
6. Restore the file to the last committed version.
7. Make another commit, then practice undoing that commit using a safe method.

---

## Block 3 – Branching & Merging

1. Create a new branch for a small feature.
2. Make changes to the file on that branch.
3. Commit the changes.
4. Switch back to the main branch.
5. Verify your change is *not* visible on the main branch.
6. Merge your feature branch into the main branch.
7. Optionally, clean up the branch.

---

## Block 4 – Working With Remotes (GitHub)

1. Create an empty repository on GitHub.
2. Connect your local repository to the GitHub remote.
3. Push your local commits to GitHub.
4. Clone the same repository into a new folder.
5. Compare both local copies and verify they match the remote.

---

## Block 5 – Fetch vs Pull

Using your two local copies:

1. In the first copy, add a new change and push it to GitHub.
2. In the second copy, check for updates without modifying your files.
3. Inspect the remote branch to see the new commit.
4. Bring the update into your working copy.
5. Review the difference between “fetch” and “pull”.

---

## Block 6 – Merge Conflict Practice

1. In copy A, create a new file and commit it.
2. Push the commit to GitHub.
3. In copy B, create a file with the **same name**, but different contents.
4. Commit the change and attempt to push.
5. Observe the error message.
6. Pull the remote changes to trigger a conflict.
7. Open the file and resolve the conflict manually.
8. Stage, commit, and push the resolved version.

---

## Block 7 – AI-Focused Exercise: Config Versioning & Experiment Tracking

1. Create a new project for ML experiments.
2. Add a configuration file defining model parameters.
3. Commit the baseline configuration.
4. Create a new branch for an experiment.
5. Modify configuration parameters for the experiment.
6. Commit the experiment configuration.
7. Tag the experiment’s commit to mark it as a “best model version”.
8. Switch back to the main branch.
